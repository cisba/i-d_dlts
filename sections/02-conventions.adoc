[quote,attribution="UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser, 2016"]
    __A distributed ledger is essentially an asset database that can be shared across
a network of multiple sites, geographies or institutions. All participants within
a network can have their own identical copy of the ledger. Any changes to the
ledger are reflected in all copies in minutes, or in some cases, seconds. The
assets can be financial, legal, physical or electronic. The security and accuracy
of the assets stored in the ledger are maintained cryptographically through the
use of ‘keys’ and signatures to control who can do what within the shared ledger.
Entries can also be updated by one, some or all of the participants, according to
rules agreed by the network.__ 

Merkle Trees::
As defined in <<RFC6962,2.1 of>>

Aggregation Server::
Where a client can submit a digest to be timestamped.
Digests are submitted for aggregation, they’re added to a list of pending digests.
Periodically that list is combined into a single merkle tree, and then the tip
of that tree is timestamped.

Calendar Server::
A calendar is simply a collection of timestamps;
a calendar server provides remote access to a calendar.
