<abstract>
  <t>This document provides a standard to extend Time-Stamp Tokens
with Time Attestations recorded on Distributed Ledgers</t>
</abstract>
</front><middle>
<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction"><t>Attesting that a file existed prior to a specific point in time can be useful - for example - to:</t>
<t>
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>prove when an agreement was signed, if it is disputed</t>
    <t>validate a signature after a revocation occurred</t>
    <t>prove the ownership for copyright</t>
    <t>grant record integrity</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>A Time-Stamp Token (TST) provided by a Time-Stamp Authority (TSA) compliant with <xref target="RFC3161"/>
can be based on an accurate time source linked to Coordinated Universal Time,
and can be very precise - it can proves the existence also at the second or less.
It is a so consolidated standard that - for example - the European Union
enforced his usage with legal effect by <xref target="eIDAS"/> Regulation,
<xref target="ETSI.EN.319.422"/> European Standard and <xref target="ETSI.TS.101.861"/> Technical Specification.</t>
<t>In a deep comparation of Time Stamping Schemes conducted in 2001 by Masashi Une <xref target="IMES"/>,
PKI TSA has been evaluated one of the the most desirables with respect to security against
alteration of a time stamp.</t>
<t>The integrity of the timestamping process that is inevitably bound to the integrity of the TSA
gave rise anyway to other proposals like <xref target="ANSI.X9.95"/> and <xref target="ISO.IEC.18014-4"/>.</t>
<t>Furthermore a TSA TST can be validated for a limited time - usually no more than 20 years -
for technical reasons - like the TSA certificates expiration -
and for economic reasons - like the cost of providing the validation service by TSA.</t>
<t>This situation gave rise also to some solutions <xref target="ETSI.TS.102.778-4"/> aimed at mitigating
the issue by extending the validity of TSA timestamps.</t>
<t>Security of a Distributed Ledger (def. in <xref target="conventions"/>) is based on hashes of data
timestamped and widely published.
Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain,
with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.</t>
<t>The advantage of a Distributed Ledger Attestation (DLA) relies on the resilience
of the distributed system and the overall design aiming to survive perpetually.</t>
<t>Based on a distributed trust scheme, a Distributed Ledger significantly increase
security as already noted by Haber and Stornetta in 1991 <xref target="HaberStornetta"/>.</t>
<t>In the case of a permissioned DL, security could be enhanced by an authoritative network of trust<xref target="Hyperledger"/><xref target="NISTIR_8202"/>.
While in the case of a permissionless DL security could be granted by the economic incentive
of nodes <xref target="Nakamoto"/>.</t>
<t>On the other hand a DLA is not yet a standard solution. Furthermore a DLA
is as less precise as bigger is the network, because distributed nodes need time to reach consensus.</t>
<t>Since a DLA results as a complementary element to provide a long-term
validity to TST - the aim of this specification is to provide an extension
of the Time-Stamp Token for Distributed Ledger Attestations (DLA).</t></section>

Given the nature and scope of this document and the lack of definitional
consensus we chosed to use the term
as defined by UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser <xref target="UK-GCSA"/>
"A distributed ledger is essentially an asset database that can be shared across
a network of multiple sites, geographies or institutions. All participants within
a network can have their own identical copy of the ledger. Any changes to the
ledger are reflected in all copies in minutes, or in some cases, seconds. The
assets can be financial, legal, physical or electronic. The security and accuracy
of the assets stored in the ledger are maintained cryptographically through the
use of &#8216;keys&#8217; and signatures to control who can do what within the shared ledger.
Entries can also be updated by one, some or all of the participants, according to
rules agreed by the network".</t>

</section>
<section anchor="main" title="DL Attestation"><t>A Digital Ledger can be viewed as an untrusted logger, serving a number of
clients who wish to store their events in the log, and
kept honest by a number of auditors who will challenge
the logger to prove its correct behavior <xref target="CrosbyWallach"/>.</t>
<t>A Merkle Tree data structure allow to accomplish this very efficently aggregating
many requests and submitting to the log periodically just the root digest of the tree.
This log is built as an hash chain (aka blockchain) of small blocks of data.
With this conditions the entire chain can be shared and mantained
by a large number of nodes, becoming a distributed system.</t>
<t>In a permissioned DL the number of nodes can be small enought to permit a quick
syncronization to reach the consensus about the state of the chain.
Instead in a permissionless DL the large number of nodes introduces a relevant delay
to reach the consensus.</t>
<t>In the case of Bitcoin the consensus is reached statistically.
Usually in an elapsed mean time of one hour six new blocks are added to the chain.
A block of data that has been added before the last six blocks
is considered practically immutable.
This is motivated by the high computational power that would be required to rewrite the chain.</t>
<t>As a result of this scenario the time elapsed - from the request of aggregation of a digest
to the proof consolidated inside the DL - could amount to more than one hour.</t>
<t>This is the motivation to distinguish from a <spanx style="strong">promise</spanx> of attestation and a <spanx style="strong">proof</spanx> of attestation.
An Aggregation Server generally can provide only a promise to timestamping the digest of the client
in the DL. After the aggregation is completed and the root hash of the Merkle Tree has been
recorded in a block of the chain, the promise is still not yet comnfirmed,</t>
<t>Only when the consensus on that block is reached - statistically, in the Bitcoin case - then
the attestation could be consideed a proof, stored and provided by a Calendar Server.</t>
<t>For simplicity of implementation, the Aggregation and the Calendar Server can be a uniq instance.
So in this document we will refer generically to a Calendar Server indicating both services.</t>
<t>The DLA data structure is out of scope of this specification. Any Calendar Server can define his application protocol and data structure. For this specification the DLA is considered as pure data.</t></section>
<section anchor="_dl_time_stamp_extension" title="DL Time-Stamp Extension"><t>A DLA, generated by a Calendar Server, MAY be included
into a TST compliant to <xref target="RFC3161"/> using a non critical extension.</t>
<t>The use of non critical extension is backward compatible with software currently availables.</t>
<t>The extension MUST follow the specifications described in <xref target="RFC3161"/> and Section 4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3280"/>.</t>
<t>The new extension MUST have the following root OID:</t>
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[
id-ce-dlts OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ce TBD1 }
]]></artwork>
</figure>
<t>where id-ce identify the root of standard extensions as described in <xref target="RFC3280"/>.</t>
<section anchor="_promise" title="Promise"><t>This extension contain the promise obtained from a Calendar Server in response to a timestamp request on the DL.
The ASN.1 structure is as follow:</t>
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[
id-ce-dlts-promise OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ce-dlts 1 }
]]></artwork>
</figure>
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[
Promise ::= SEQUENCE {
    version          [0] INTEGER,
    dlpromise        [1] DLPromise }
]]></artwork>
</figure>
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[
DLPromise ::= OCTET STRING
]]></artwork>
</figure>
<t>The data timestamped by the DLA SHALL be an hash of
the same data that will be signed by the TSA without the DL extension itself.</t></section>
<section anchor="_proof" title="Proof"><t>This extension contain the proof obtained from a Calendar Server in response to a timestamp upgrade request of a previously obtained promise.
The ASN.1 structure is as follow:</t>
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[
id-ce-dlts-proof OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
    id-ce-dlts 2 }
]]></artwork>
</figure>
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[
Proof ::= SEQUENCE {
      version        [0] INTEGER,
      dlproof        [1] DLProof,
      blockchain     [2] UTF8String }
]]></artwork>
</figure>
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[
DLProof ::= OCTET STRING
]]></artwork>
</figure>
<t>The upgrade from a promise to a proof MAY be done requesting a new TST, including
the DL extension containing the promise prevously obtained.
When the TSA receive a request containing a DL extension
if there is a pending promise inside, it MAY request the Calendar Server to get the
proof and MAY include it in the new TST.</t></section></section>
<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations"><t>Every security consideration described in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC3161"/> SHALL be evaluated designing
TSA services that include DL Time-Stamp extensions.</t>
<t>When a TSA execute a request to a Calendar Servers the use of a nonce is
RECOMMENDED because using a nonce always allows to detect replays.</t></section>
