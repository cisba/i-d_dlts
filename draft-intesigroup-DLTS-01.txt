1.  Introduction

   Attesting that a file existed prior to a specific point in time can
   be useful - for example - to:

   o  prove when an agreement was signed, if it is disputed

   o  validate a signature after a revocation occurred

   o  prove the ownership for copyright

   o  grant record integrity

   A Time-Stamp Token (TST) provided by a Time-Stamp Authority (TSA)
   compliant with [RFC3161] can be based on an accurate time source
   linked to Coordinated Universal Time, and can be very precise - it
   can proves the existence also at the second or less.  It is a so
   consolidated standard that - for example - the European Union
   enforced his usage with legal effect by [eIDAS] Regulation,
   [ETSI.EN.319.422] European Standard and [ETSI.TS.101.861] Technical
   Specification.

   In a deep comparation of Time Stamping Schemes conducted in 2001 by
   Masashi Une [IMES], PKI TSA has been evaluated one of the the most
   desirables with respect to security against alteration of a time
   stamp.

   The integrity of the timestamping process that is inevitably bound to
   the integrity of the TSA gave rise anyway to other proposals like
   [ANSI.X9.95] and [ISO.IEC.18014-4].

   Furthermore a TSA TST can be validated for a limited time - usually
   no more than 20 years - for technical reasons - like the TSA
   certificates expiration - and for economic reasons - like the cost of
   providing the validation service by TSA.

   This situation gave rise also to some solutions [ETSI.TS.102.778-4]
   aimed at mitigating the issue by extending the validity of TSA
   timestamps.

   Security of a Distributed Ledger (def. in Section 2) is based on
   hashes of data timestamped and widely published.  Each timestamp
   includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with
   each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.

   The advantage of a Distributed Ledger Attestation (DLA) relies on the
   resilience of the distributed system and the overall design aiming to
   survive perpetually.

   Based on a distributed trust scheme, a Distributed Ledger
   significantly increase security as already noted by Haber and
   Stornetta in 1991 [HaberStornetta].

   In the case of a permissioned DL, security could be enhanced by an
   authoritative network of trust[Hyperledger][NISTIR_8202].  While in
   the case of a permissionless DL security could be granted by the
   economic incentive of nodes [Nakamoto].

   On the other hand a DLA is not yet a standard solution.  Furthermore
   a DLA is as less precise as bigger is the network, because
   distributed nodes need time to reach consensus.

   Since a DLA results as a complementary element to provide a long-term
   validity to TST - the aim of this specification is to provide an
   extension of the Time-Stamp Token for Distributed Ledger Attestations
   (DLA).

2.  Terms and Definitions

   The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
   "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*NOT
   RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only
   when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

   This document also refers to the following terms and definitions:

   Public Key Infrastructure
      As defined in [RFC5280]

   Trusted Tirth Party
      As defined in [RFC3161]

   Time-Stamp Authority
      As defined in [RFC3161]

   Time-Stamp Token
      As defined in [RFC3161]

   Distributed Ledger
      Various definitions of blockchain and distributed ledger
      technology exist, and some of these stress different technical
      features.  Given the nature and scope of this document and the
      lack of definitional consensus we chosed to use the term as
      defined by UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser [UK-GCSA] "A
      distributed ledger is essentially an asset database that can be
      shared across a network of multiple sites, geographies or
      institutions.  All participants within a network can have their
      own identical copy of the ledger.  Any changes to the ledger are
      reflected in all copies in minutes, or in some cases, seconds.
      The assets can be financial, legal, physical or electronic.  The
      security and accuracy of the assets stored in the ledger are
      maintained cryptographically through the use of 'keys' and
      signatures to control who can do what within the shared ledger.
      Entries can also be updated by one, some or all of the
      participants, according to rules agreed by the network".

   Merkle Tree
      As defined in [Merkle], [CrosbyWallach] andSection 2.1 of
      [RFC6962]

   Aggregation Server
      A server providing the aggregation in a Merke Tree of digests to
      be timestamped.  Digests submitted for aggregation are added to a
      list periodically combined into a single Merkle Tree.  Then the
      digest at the root of that tree is timestamped on a Distributed
      Ledger.

   Distributed Ledger Attestation
      A Distributed Ledger (Timestamping) Attestation is a proof or a
      promise of timestamping in a precise Distributed Ledger.

   Calendar
      A calendar is simply a collection of Distributed Ledger
      Attestations.

   Calendar Server

4.  DL Attestation

   A Digital Ledger can be viewed as an untrusted logger, serving a
   number of clients who wish to store their events in the log, and kept
   honest by a number of auditors who will challenge the logger to prove
   its correct behavior [CrosbyWallach].

   A Merkle Tree data structure allow to accomplish this very efficently
   aggregating many requests and submitting to the log periodically just
   the root digest of the tree.  This log is built as an hash chain (aka
   blockchain) of small blocks of data.  With this conditions the entire
   chain can be shared and mantained by a large number of nodes,
   becoming a distributed system.

   In a permissioned DL the number of nodes can be small enought to
   permit a quick syncronization to reach the consensus about the state
   of the chain.  Instead in a permissionless DL the large number of
   nodes introduces a relevant delay to reach the consensus.

   In the case of Bitcoin the consensus is reached statistically.
   Usually in an elapsed mean time of one hour six new blocks are added
   to the chain.  A block of data that has been added before the last
   six blocks is considered practically immutable.  This is motivated by
   the high computational power that would be required to rewrite the
   chain.



Cisbani, et al.           Expires July 16, 2020                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    DLTS                      January 2020


   As a result of this scenario the time elapsed - from the request of
   aggregation of a digest to the proof consolidated inside the DL -
   could amount to more than one hour.

   This is the motivation to distinguish from a *promise* of attestation
   and a *proof* of attestation.  An Aggregation Server generally can
   provide only a promise to timestamping the digest of the client in
   the DL.  After the aggregation is completed and the root hash of the
   Merkle Tree has been recorded in a block of the chain, the promise is
   still not yet comnfirmed,

   Only when the consensus on that block is reached - statistically, in
   the Bitcoin case - then the attestation could be consideed a proof,
   stored and provided by a Calendar Server.

   For simplicity of implementation, the Aggregation and the Calendar
   Server can be a uniq instance.  So in this document we will refer
   generically to a Calendar Server indicating both services.

   The DLA data structure is out of scope of this specification.  Any
   Calendar Server can define his application protocol and data
   structure.  For this specification the DLA is considered as pure
   data.

5.  DL Time-Stamp Extension

   A DLA, generated by a Calendar Server, MAY be included into a TST
   compliant to [RFC3161] using a non critical extension.

   The use of non critical extension is backward compatible with
   software currently availables.

   The extension MUST follow the specifications described in [RFC3161]
   and Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5280].

   The new extension MUST have the following root OID:

   id-ce-dlts OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ce TBD1 }

   where id-ce identify the root of standard extensions as described in
   [RFC5280].

5.1.  Promise

   This extension contain the promise obtained from a Calendar Server in
   response to a timestamp request on the DL.  The ASN.1 structure is as
   follow:




Cisbani, et al.           Expires July 16, 2020                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    DLTS                      January 2020


   id-ce-dlts-promise OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ce-dlts 1 }

   Promise ::= SEQUENCE {
       version          [0] INTEGER,
       dlpromise        [1] DLPromise }

   DLPromise ::= OCTET STRING

   The data timestamped by the DLA SHALL be an hash of the same data
   that will be signed by the TSA without the DL extension itself.

5.2.  Proof

   This extension contain the proof obtained from a Calendar Server in
   response to a timestamp upgrade request of a previously obtained
   promise.  The ASN.1 structure is as follow:

   id-ce-dlts-proof OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       id-ce-dlts 2 }

   Proof ::= SEQUENCE {
         version        [0] INTEGER,
         dlproof        [1] DLProof,
         blockchain     [2] UTF8String }

   DLProof ::= OCTET STRING

   The upgrade from a promise to a proof MAY be done requesting a new
   TST, including the DL extension containing the promise prevously
   obtained.  When the TSA receive a request containing a DL extension
   if there is a pending promise inside, it MAY request the Calendar
   Server to get the proof and MAY include it in the new TST.

6.  Security Considerations

   Every security consideration described in Section 4 of [RFC3161]
   SHALL be evaluated designing TSA services that include DL Time-Stamp
   extensions.

   When a TSA execute a request to a Calendar Servers the use of a nonce
   is RECOMMENDED because using a nonce always allows to detect replays.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action by IANA.
