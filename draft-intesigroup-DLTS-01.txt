1.  Introduction

   Attesting that a file existed prior to a specific point in time can
   be useful to:

   o  prove when an agreement was signed, if it is disputed

   o  validate a signature after a revocation occurred

   o  prove the ownership for copyright

   o  grant record Integrity

   A Time-Stamp Token (TST) provided by a Time-Stamp Authority (TSA)
   compliant with [RFC3161] can be based on an accurate time source
   linked to Coordinated Universal Time, and can be very precise - it
   can proves the existence also at the second or less.  It is a so
   consolidated standard that - for example - the European Union
   enforced his usage with legal effect by [eIDAS] Regulation,
   [ETSI.EN.319.422] European Standard and [ETSI.TS.101.861] Technical
   Specification.

   In a deep comparation of Time Stamping Schemes conducted in 2001 by
   Masashi Une [IMES], PKI TSA has been evaluated one of the the most
   desirables with respect to security against alteration of a time
   stamp.

Internet-Draft                    DLTS                      January 2020


   The integrity of the timestamping process that is inevitably bound to
   the integrity of the TSA gave rise anyway to other proposals like
   [ANSI.X9.95] and [ISO.IEC.18014-4].

   Furthermore a TSA TST can be validated for a limited time - usually
   no more than 20 years - for technical reasons - like the TSA
   certificates expiration - and for economic reasons - like the cost of
   providing the validation service by TSA.

   This situation gave rise also to some solutions [ETSI.TS.102.778-4]
   aimed at mitigating the issue by extending the validity of TSA
   timestamps.

   Distributed Ledgers [UK-GCSA] security is based on hashes of data
   timestamped and widely published.  Each timestamp includes the
   previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional
   timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.

   The advantage of a DL Time-Stamp attestation relies on the resilience
   of the distributed system and the overall design aiming to survive
   perpetually.

   Based on a distributed trust scheme, a Distributed Ledger
   significantly increase security as already noted by Haber and
   Stornetta in 1991 [Haber-Stornetta].

   In the case of a permissioned DL, security could be enhanced by an
   authoritative network of trust.  While in the case of a
   permissionless DL security is granted by the economic incentive of
   nodes [Nakamoto].

   On the other hand a DL attestation, is not yet a standard.
   Furthermore a DL attestation is as less precise - it proves the
   existence at a specific hour or day - as bigger and secure is the
   network: because distributed nodes need time to reach consensus.

   Since a DL timestamp result as a complementary element to provide a
   long-term validity to TST - the aim of this specification is to
   provide an extension of the Time-Stamp Token for Distributed Ledger
   attestations.

2.  Terms and Definitions

   The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
   "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*NOT
   RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only
   when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

   This document also refers to the following terms and definitions:

   Public Key Infrastructure
      As defined in [RFC3280]

   Trusted Tirth Party
      As defined in [RFC3161]

   Time-Stamp Authority
      As defined in [RFC3161]

   Time-Stamp Token
      As defined in [RFC3161]

   Distributed Ledger
      As defined by UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser [UK-GCSA] "A
      distributed ledger is essentially an asset database that can be
      shared across a network of multiple sites, geographies or
      institutions.  All participants within a network can have their
      own identical copy of the ledger.  Any changes to the ledger are
      reflected in all copies in minutes, or in some cases, seconds.
      The assets can be financial, legal, physical or electronic.  The
      security and accuracy of the assets stored in the ledger are
      maintained cryptographically through the use of 'keys' and
      signatures to control who can do what within the shared ledger.
      Entries can also be updated by one, some or all of the
      participants, according to rules agreed by the network".

   Merkle Tree
      As defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC6962]

   Aggregation Server
      A server providing the aggregation in a Merke Tree of digests to
      be timestamped.  Digests submitted for aggregation are added to a
      list periodically combined nto a single Merkle Tree.  Then the
      digest at the root of that tree is timestamped on a Distributed
      Ledger.

   Calendar
      A calendar is simply a collection of timestamps promises and
      proofs.

   Calendar Server
      A server providing remote access to a collection of timestamps.

4.2.  Merkle Trees and Aggregation

4.3.  Calendar Servers

5.  OpenTimestamps

   Il timestamp di tipo opentimestamps (basato su blockchain) dovra
   essere generato tramite l'utilizzo di un calendar server e inserito
   come estensione non critica all'interno di un timestamp che segue lo
   standard [RFC3161].

   L'aggiunta dell'estensione non critica rende il timestamp finale
   retro-compatibile con i software di verifica attualmente disponibili.

   L'estensione deve rispettare le indicazioni riportate in [RFC3161] e
   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC3280].

   Gli OID delle nuove estensioni avranno la seguente radice:

   id-ce-opentimestamps   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ce 99 }

   dove id-ce identifica la radice delle estensioni standard vedi
   [RFC3280].

5.1.  OpenTimestamps Promise

   Questa estensione rappresenta la "promessa" restituita dal calendar
   server in risposta alla richiesta di marcatura di un hash.  Di
   seguito e riportata la struttura ASN.1:

   id-ce-opentimestamps-promise OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       id-ce-opentimestamps 1 }

   Promise ::= SEQUENCE {
       version          [0] INTEGER,
       otsPromise       [1] OtsPromise }

   OtsPromise ::= OCTET STRING

5.1.1.  OpenTimestamps Proof

   Questa estensione rappresenta la "prova" restituita dal calendar
   server in risposta alla richiesta di upgrade di una promessa
   precedentemente ricevuta.  Di seguito e riportata la struttura ASN.1:

   id-ce-opentimestamps-proof OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       id-ce-opentimestamps 2 }

   Proof ::= SEQUENCE {
         version        [0] INTEGER,
         otsProof       [1] OtsProof,
         blockchain     [2] UTF8String }

   OtsProof ::= OCTET STRING

5.2.  Code snippets

   Code snippets should be wrapped with "<CODE BEGINS>" and "<CODE
   ENDS>" blocks, as required by the IETF Trust Legal Provisions (TLP)
   [IETF.TLP] (Section 4) specified in [RFC5378].

6.  Security Considerations

   Any security considerations should be placed here.

   As described in Section 4 (here's how you refer a local anchor),
   local tools have to be installed before the document template can be
   built.

   Running of these local tools *MAY* produce unintended side effects
   that impact security.  For example
